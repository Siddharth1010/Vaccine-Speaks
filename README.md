# Vaccine-Speaks

## Objective

Vacine Speaks presents a general overview of how people in different regions of the same country are satisfied or dissatisfied with COVID-19 vaccines. This portal will depict the impact of the vaccine, regionally, across the United States and the Indian subcontinent. It will provide an idea of what people in particular areas think about the vaccine through four categories - POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, MIXED and NEUTRAL. This classification is done by extracting Twitter data with its latitude and longitude.
